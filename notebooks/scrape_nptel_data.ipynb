Originally adopted in military networks as a means of ensuring secure communication when confronted with the threats of jamming and interception, spread spectrum systems are now the core of commercial applications such as mobile cellular and satellite communications. The Global Positioning System (GPS) is the first commercial communication system that uses spread spectrum signals enabling ranging, jamming protection, multipath protection and high degree of range precision. In today’s world, there are more applications of spread spectrum on the commercial side than on the military side. CDMA is a popular multiple access scheme where several users share the same physical medium, that is, the same frequency at the same time. CDMA is based on spread spectrum technique where the spectral band is spread by multiplying each user’s signal by unique orthogonal pseudorandom sequence. Orthogonality of the codes ensures the retrieval of information without interference from each other where spreading allows the receiver to take benefit from multipath properties of the mobile radio channel. Over the years, the most successful implementation of spread spectrum communication in commercial world lies in cdma 2000, WCDMA and UMTS, a 3G mobile communication system, WLAN, Ultra Wideband Communications (UWB), Body Area Networks, and energy efficient Radio Architecture design for future generation Millimeter Wave (mmWave) communications. The common cordless phone utilizes spread spectrum technology to provide a telephonic interference-rejecting communication link in both 900 MHz and 2.4 GHz bands. In addition, spread spectrum communication methods have been considered an alternative to hard wiring for indoor private branch offices, laboratories, or factories where the transmission medium involves severe multipath fading.', 'instructor_name': 'Prof. Debarati Sen', 'instructor_bio': 'Debarati Sen is presently an Assistant Professor at the G.S.S.

Computing has taken many shapes from edge to cloud. This course has been designed with an objective to provide a comprehensive understanding of relevant technologies (IoT, ML and Cloud) for various emerging computing paradigms of Edge Computing. Emerging Internet of Things (IoT) applications such as augmented reality, self-driving automobiles, and many others are delay sensitive and computation expensive, require real-time processing of massive amounts of data generated by distributed end users. Although the success of cloud computing for supporting high performance computing has been witnessed in recent years, its inefficiency in quality of service (QoS) provisioning for delay sensitive applications as well as high energy consumption has been the bottleneck for the development of delay-sensitive IoT applications. Edge computing has recently developed as a cloud computing extension for QoS provisioning for time-sensitive applications. By deploying computing and network resources along the path between data sources and cloud datacenters, it enables cloud-like computing at the network edge. This course provides an in-depth understanding of terminologies and the core concepts behind Cloud-IoT-Edge problems, applications, systems and the techniques, that underlie today's cutting-edge technologies. It provides an introduction to some of the start-of-the-art IoT and wireless networks, edge and virtualization technologies, recent trends in computer hardware for artificial intelligence, spatial localization and detection, tensor processing unit for fast and affordable artificial intelligence (AI). And while discussing the concepts and techniques, we will also look at various applications of Cloud-IoT-Edge using Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and many others.

Major part of the later half will focus on understanding the theoretical aspect of diffusion including atomic mechanisms of diffusion, fundamental driving forces for diffusion and dependence of phenomenological diffusion coefficients on atomic jump frequencies and thermodynamic factors. All the concepts and treatments will be explained in the context of both binary and multicomponent effects in diffusion. At the end of the course, the student should be able to describe diffusion in dilute as well as concentrated multicomponent alloys in terms of multicomponent diffusion coefficients, solve the diffusion equation for various processes, identify the various types of diffusion coefficients and select the appropriate type for a given model, understand the physical significance of these coefficients, evaluate these coefficients theoretically for some model systems and know the various methodologies of their experimental determination.', 'instructor_name': 'Prof. Kaustubh Kulkarni', 'instructor_bio': 'I finished my PhD from Purdue University on the topic of multicomponent diffusion.

The areas that this course explores are broadly: construction of the Indian womanhood; intersecting structures of gender, caste, class, religion, and sexuality; body and violence; evolution of ‘gender’ and ‘sexuality’ through history; contemporary ruminations. This course intends to identify Indian feminism not as a monolithic homogeneous narrative, but as one rooted in different epistemic practices.

We are continuously trashing our planet and harming ourselves in the process. And this is when we know so much about what the issues are, how and why they arise, and how they can be solved. We have the technological solutions; and still we’re largely unable to actually solve the problems. This is largely because these problems require not just a technological solution – they also require reworking of national and global policies. And solving the problems will entail costs and require money – such as for treating waste water before disposal, for increasing the efficiency of resource utilisation to reduce overconsumption of resources, for shifting to greener sources of energy that don’t emit greenhouse gases, for shifting to green chemistry that doesn’t pollute, for making infrastructures that do not harm the wildlife, and for incentivising more research to make better technologies. It is these costs, and not just a lack of technology, that prevent us from solving the problems. Thus, the need of the hour is to understand the Economics of Conservation to create an environment where we can use technologies to solve our problems.

India has such a rich legacy of poetic forms, and its poetic voices have always generated a magnetic effect on those who have had the patience to hear. The course entitled Indian Poetry in English seeks to take a plunge into the ocean-like ethos of Indian poetry and send ripples across to poetry lovers. The course is designed keeping in mind the learners’ need to realise the journey of Indian English poetry the way it started and continues to make its presence felt, struggling at times and coping with the challenges yet emerging victorious. Though not organised chronologically, majority of the poets selected for this course usually are prescribed in Indian universities. In addition, the course also introduces passionate learners to many contemporary Indian English poets whose voices have received scant attention because of some unsaid reasons. This course would familiarise the attendees with the quintessential ethos of Indianness comprising the musical, philosophical, aesthetic, and cultural legacy of Indian poets, offering a valuable discussion on some of their poems garnished with poetic insights. The course includes interactive lectures, assignments and, of course, evaluation towards the end.', 'instructor_name': 'Prof. Binod Mishra', 'instructor_bio': 'Prof. Binod Mishra, presently a professor in the Department of HSS, IIT Roorkee, has been teaching English for more than two decades at various levels.
