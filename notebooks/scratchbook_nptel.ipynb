He joined Radiochemistry Division, BARC in 1987 after graduating from the 30th Batch of the BARC training school. He did his Ph.D. from University of Bombay in 1994 and did post-doctoral research at University of Mainz, Germany (1999-2000) under the Alexander von Humboldt fellowship. His research interests include separation of actinides and fission products using novel extractants, in ionic liquid based solvents and novel separation techniques including liquid membranes. Based on his contributions in the area of separation of actinide and fission products from radioactive feeds he has been given the DAE-SRC outstanding researcher award (2009) and the Homi Bhabha Science & Technology Award (2010). In view of his excellent contribution to separation science and technology, he has been elected as an honorary Fellow of National Academy of Sciences, Allahabad. A recognized guide of Mumbai University and Homi Bhabha National Institute (Deemed University), Dr. Mohapatra is an Associate Editor of Separation Science and Technology and one of the Editors of Radiochimica Acta. He is in the advisory board of several prestigious journals including Solvent Extraction and Ion Exchange. Currently, he is heading Radiochemistry Division of BARC.
